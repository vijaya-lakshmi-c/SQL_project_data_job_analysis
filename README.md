# Background
This project was created to help navigate the data analyst job market by identifying the highest-paying and most in-demand skills, making it easier for others to find the best job opportunities.

Data hails from [Data source](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). 
The dataset used is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The goal of my SQL queries was to answer the following questions:
1. What are the top_paying data analyst jobs ?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs ?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts ?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries ? 
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn ?

# Tools I Used
For my in-depth analysis of the data analyst job market, I utilized several essential tools:

- **SQL:** Served as the foundation of my analysis, enabling me to query data effectively and extract meaningful insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system used for storing and managing job posting data efficiently.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary environment for writing and executing SQL queries, as well as managing database interactions.
- **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and sharing code, facilitating collaboration and keeping track of project progress. 

# The Analysis
Each query in this project was designed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by avergae yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query hilights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    job_postings_fact.job_location,
    job_postings_fact.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings_fact.job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- High Salary Potential: Top 10 data analyst roles range from $184K to $650K, showing strong earning opportunities.

2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To identify the skills required for top-paying roles, I joined the job postings with the skills dataset, revealing what employers prioritize in high-compensation positions.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_postings_fact.job_title,
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills 
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id =skills_dim.skill_id
